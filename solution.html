        <p>An application that converts text-to-speech and assists the user in keeping track of the points in the discussion. When a person in the team speaks, the application converts the words into text and displays on the screen for the hard-of-hearing
            team members. The application would have the capability of separating each speaker so that the deaf member is aware of who the speaker is whenever someone speaks.<br><br>In cases where the deaf member feels that a speaker is speaking fast
            (text conversion is fast) and that it is difficult to follow what the person is saying, or if they want to put forth their own points, or if they want to ask a question, the application has clickable buttons which on clicking, produce a sound
            as to notify the speakers that the deaf member has requested for a pause.This would help the discussion to progress smoothly while providing every member in the team to having equal chance to voice their ideas and have a say in the discussion.</p>
